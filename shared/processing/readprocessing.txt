here which i have got by connecting the arduino to pc and executing the com.c program
then it outputs audio.raw (detail in comments)
although my system can play audio.raw using aplay driver for different systems
use ffmpeg to convert audio.raw to any format here .wav (audio.raw is a over
written file)

examples include (disturbance due to tesla coil , normal disturbance , and my "heart will go on song"
